# calorie_calculator
This is the AUA ENGS110 individual project. 
Everyone requires different amounts of energy each day, depending on age, sex, size, and activity level. By using this app people will know which food will give them particular amount of calorie and will maintain their energy level.  
Target audience is people who are concerned about their health. 
At first the user must input his weight, height, age, gender, status of activity, etc. , so the app can define the amount of calorie he needs daily. Then everyday the user tells the food he eat during the day. The app will tell him the amount of his calories at any time of the day and if the user crosses the limit needed. 
The app already has stored info about how much calories every food contains and formulas to calculate the needed daily calories. It will use this formulas

Men 
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm ) - (5 × age in years) + 5 

Women 
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161 

 
If you are sedentary (little or no exercise)- Daily calories= BMR x 1.2. 
If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) Daily calories = BMR x 1.375. 
If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) -Daily calories = BMR x 1.55
If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week)- Daily calories = BMR x 1.725. 
If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training)- Daily calories= BMR x 1.9.
