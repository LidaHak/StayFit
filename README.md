# calorie_calculator
This is the AUA ENGS110 individual project. 
Everyone requires different amounts of energy each day, depending on age, sex, size, and activity level. By using this app people will know which food will give them particular amount of calorie and will maintain their energy level.  
Target audience is people who are concerned about their health. 
At first the user must input his weight, height, age, gender, status of activity, etc. , so the app can define the amount of calories he/she needs daily. Then everyday the user tells the food he consumes during the day. The app will tell him the amount of his calories of any time, of any date. 
The app already has stored info about how much calories every food contains and formulas to calculate the needed daily calories and also the calories you burnt during exercising. 

***
People who want to use this app shall download the excel file of exercises(in my repository). After downloading you just need to change the file path in the main code and type the path from your device.
